            <h2>Recipe</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>100g plain flour</li>
                <li>pinch of salt</li>
                <li>1 tbsp sunflower oil or vegetable, plus extra for frying</li>
                <li>300ml semi-skimmed milk</li>
                <li>2 egg</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Method</h2>
            <p>
                Blending in the flour: Put the flour and a pinch of salt into a large mixing bowl and make a well in the centre. Crack the
                eggs into the middle, then pour in about 50ml milk and 1 tbsp oil. Start whisking from the centre, gradually
                drawing the flour into the eggs, milk and oil. Once all the flour is incorporated, beat until you have a
                smooth, thick paste. Add a little more milk if it is too stiff to beat.<br><br> Finishing
                the batter: Add a good splash of milk and whisk to loosen the thick batter. While still whisking, pour in
                a steady stream of the remaining milk. Continue pouring and whisking until you have a batter that is the
                consistency of slightly thick single cream. Traditionally, people would say to now leave the batter for 30
                mins, to allow the starch in the flour to swell, but thereâ€™s no need.<br><br> Getting the right thickness:
                Heat the pan over a moderate heat, then wipe it with oiled kitchen paper. Ladle some batter into the pan,
                tilting the pan to move the mixture around for a thin and even layer. Quickly pour any excess batter into
                a jug, return the pan to the heat, then leave to cook, undisturbed, for about 30 secs. Pour the excess batter
                from the jug back into the mixing bowl. If the pan is the right temperature, the pancake should turn golden
                underneath after about 30 secs and will be ready to turn.
